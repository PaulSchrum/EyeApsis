EyeApsis
=========

Eye Chart for measuring vision in non-certified conditions.
That means anywhere but an optometrist's or ophthalmologist's office.

This software can be used by individuals in their own home.  It could be
used at a pharmacy like those automatic blood pressure machines.  Or
it could be used by health care professionals or care givers at nursing
homes and the like.

It is primarily used for measuring visual acuity.
